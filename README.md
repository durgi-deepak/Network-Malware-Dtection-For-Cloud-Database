# Network Malware Detection For Cloud Infrastructure

The project can be divided into four modules. The first module deals with adding the Relaibiliy Features and  Network constituents Characteristics to the database. The second module deals with adding the Network Performance Traits and creating the graphical user interfaces. The third module comprises of running Gaussian Process classification on the dataset. The fourth module deals with running Decision Tree Classification on the same dataset, in order to tally the accuracies and plot a comparison chart. 


##  Problem Definition
The project aims at developing a tool for Network Malware Detection for Cloud Infrastructure, with all the above mentioned advantages.This tool is developed by using Python along with its layout toolkit PyQt, PyUIC and sklearn modules.
## Algorithms Used 
- Gaussian Process Classification 
- Decision Tree Classification
## Input Features
#### The Input dataset consists of following features

- Network Relaibiliy Features
- Network Performance Traits 
- Network constituents Characteristics.



## Output Analysis
- Comparison plot of Gaussian process vs. Decision Tree
- Gaussian Process predictions
- Decision Tree predictions
- Accuracies of  gaussian process & Decision Tree

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
import sys
import os
from malware import *
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, QtGui, QtCore

class MyForm(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self,parent=None):
     QtWidgets.QWidget.__init__(self,parent)
     self.ui = Ui_MainWindow()
     self.ui.setupUi(self)
     self.ui.pushButton_3.clicked.connect(self.cplot)
     self.ui.pushButton_7.clicked.connect(self.npt)
     self.ui.pushButton_5.clicked.connect(self.nrftrs)
     self.ui.pushButton_4.clicked.connect(self.gpc)
     self.ui.pushButton_6.clicked.connect(self.dtc)
     self.ui.pushButton_8.clicked.connect(self.ncc)
     

  def cplot(self):
    os.system("python bar_chart1.py")

  def npt(self):
    os.system("python perftraits1.py")

  def nrftrs(self):
    os.system("python reliabftrs1.py")

  def gpc(self):
    os.system("python gpc1.py")
	
  def ncc(self):
    os.system("python constchars1.py")

  def dtc(self):
    os.system("python dtc1.py")

          
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    myapp = MyForm()
    myapp.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

```
